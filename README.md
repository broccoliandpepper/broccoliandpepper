## Welcome to my GitHub 👋

### Hi there, I’m Jean-Marc

ICT **System** Engineer & IT Project Lead with 15+ years of experience on Microsoft infrastructures: Windows Server, Active Directory, Microsoft 365 and Entra ID.  
I design, secure and automate infrastructures so that teams can focus on their work instead of fighting with IT.
