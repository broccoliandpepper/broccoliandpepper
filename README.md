## Welcome to my GitHub

### Hi there, I’m Jean-Marc 👋

ICT **System** Engineer & IT project lead with 15+ years of experience on Microsoft infrastructures: Windows Server, Active Directory, Microsoft 365 and Entra ID. [web:39][web:46]

### What I work with

- 🔧 Daily drivers: PowerShell, Windows Server, AD, M365, Entra ID
- ☁️ Interests: automation, security hardening, infrastructure as code, clean documentation
- 🧩 What I enjoy: troubleshooting nasty infra issues, making repetitive tasks disappear with scripts, helping teams understand what’s running under the hood [web:39][web:43]

### What you’ll find here

- 🛠️ Scripts and small tools for system administration and automation  
- 🧪 Lab projects and experiments around Microsoft infrastructures and security  
- 📚 Configuration examples and notes I use to document what I learn [web:20][web:42]

### What I’m looking for

- Roles mixing system engineering, automation and project coordination  
- Environments where I can modernize infra, reduce manual work and improve security [web:39][web:46]
